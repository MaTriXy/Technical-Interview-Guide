	A dictionary is a type of data structure that is supported natively in all major interpreted languages
	such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby and PHP, where itâ€™s known as an Object, Dictionary, Hash and Array,
	respectively. In simple terms, a dictionary is a collection of unique keys and their values. The values can 
	typically be of any primitive type (i.e an integer, boolean, double, string etc) or other dictionaries 
	(dictionaries can be nested).

	Given a dictionary dict, write a function flattenDictionary that returns a flattened version of it.

	input:  dict = {
            Key1 : 1,
            Key2 : {
                a : 2,
                b : 3,
                c : {
                    d : 3,
                    e : 1
                }
            }
        }

	output: {
            Key1: 1,
            Key2.a: 2,
            Key2.b : 3,
            Key2.c.d : 3,
            Key2.c.e : 1
        }
