# N Queen Problem

'''
	The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 

	Solution: The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column. When we place a queen 
	in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens. In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no 
	clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution. If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and 
	return false.

		As we are placing column wise, we need to check only for all previous columns, upper diagonal and lower diagonal
